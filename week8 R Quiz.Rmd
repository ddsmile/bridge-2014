1

```{r}
(x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7))
(y <- c(7,6,5,4,3,2,1))
```

Addition by for loop

```{r}
sum <- vector(mode='numeric', length =length(x))
for (i in 1:length(x)){
  sum[i] <- x[i]+y[i]
}
sum
```

Addition by direct vector calculation is more efficient.
```{r}
vector.sum <- x+y
vector.sum
```

2
```{r}
coin.vector <- c("heads","heads","tails","heads")
i <- 1
count <- 0
while (coin.vector[i]=='heads'){
  count <- count + 1
  i <- i + 1
}
count 

```
3
With for loop
```{r}
num <- seq(1,100)
total <- 0
for (i in 1:length(num)){
  total <- total + ifelse(num[i] %% 2!=0, num[i], 0)
}
total
```
Without for loop
```{r}
total.nlp <- sum(seq(1,100,2))
total.nlp
```
